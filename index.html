          What are Pointers
        </h1>
        <p>
          One of the most confusing concepts in programming and computer science is pointers.  
          Here I'll try to explain what pointers really are, as well as reference some really
          good sources to grasp the concept of pointers. Let's get to the point.

      <p>Pointers are basically variables that, well, point somewhere. This somewhere is usually
        a memory address associated with another variable. To understand things a bit better, it's
