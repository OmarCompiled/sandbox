          What are Pointers
        </h1>
        <p>
          One of the most confusing concepts in programming and computer science is pointers.  
          Here I'll try to explain what pointers really are, as well as reference some really
          good sources to grasp the concept of pointers. Let's get to the point.

      <h3>Pointers</h3>
      <p>Pointers are basically variables that, well, point somewhere. This somewhere is usually
        a memory address associated with another variable. To understand things a bit better, it's
        better to look at an example.
      </p>

      <p>
        The example above shows the pointer syntax in C++. Although this example is in C++,
        you can follow along in your preferred language(that has pointers!). We defined an integer
        variable with value 5, then we defined another variable, which is a pointer to an integer,
        that has the memory address of the integer variable "number". Notice how I said "pointer to variable".
        This is because pointers are what's called <strong>"Compound Data Types"</strong>, which essentially means that they are
        defined in terms of other data types. So, for example, a pointer with the memory address of a character variable would
        be a pointer to a character.

      <p>
        You can see the results to the previous code in the image above. The first line in the results is what happens when the
        pointer is output to the terminal as it is. This number is the memory address of whatever the pointer is pointing to.
        The second line is what happpens when we output the pointer to the terminal after <strong>dereferncing</strong> it. Dereferencing basically means
        telling the compiler that we want to access what's <strong>inside</strong> the address stored inside the pointer. In this case,
        that address stores an integer variable.

      <h3>Why use pointers anyway?</h3>
      <p>
        Well, pointers have many uses. Pointers are actually used when allocating strings and arrays(obviously implicictly).
